# My Learning Notes on MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra

## Introduction
- My Greatest Thanks to Professor Gilbert Strang, the instructor of this course.
- I used Python instead of MATLAB for all the coding problems.
- I am using a MacBook Air A1466 from 2015. It installed PyTorch version 2.2.2 for Intel macOS. My laptop does not have a compatible GPU, and it does not have an Apple Silicon chip.
- I am using the fourth edition of the **Introduction to Linear Algebra** textbook.
